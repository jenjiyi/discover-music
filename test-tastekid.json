His first solo album, 1988's Viva Hate, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one.Morrissey is widely regarded as an important innovator in the indie music scene; music magazine NME considers Morrissey to be "one of the most influential artists ever", while The Independent says, "Most pop stars have to be dead before they reach the iconic status he has reached in his lifetime."

The group's most prominent early line-up was Brett Anderson (singer), Bernard Butler (guitarist), Mat Osman (bass guitarist) and Simon Gilbert (drummer). By 1992, Suede were described as "The Best New Band in Britain", and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their debut album Suede, went to the top of the charts by becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. It won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster Britpop as a musical genre. However, the band's lush follow-up, Dog Man Star (1994), showed Suede distancing themselves from their Britpop peers. Although it is often regarded as the band's masterpiece, the recording sessions for Dog Man Star were fraught with difficulty, and ended with Butler departing the band after confrontations with Anderson and musical differences with the other members. Its sales suffered due to these events, however it was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has, over time been lauded with universal acclaim from critics.",

Different Class spawned four top ten singles, including "Common People" and "Sorted for E's & Wizz", both of which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart.

He was raised in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. He was a school friend of Daniel Ash.Daniel Ash convinced Murphy to join Bauhaus, one of the establishing acts of the goth movement. Their use of spacey recording effects and theatrical aesthetics was evocative of glam rock; they became an influential group in the early days of gothic rock. In 1983, Bauhaus appeared during the opening sequences of the horror film The Hunger, performing one of their most popular songs, "Bela Lugosi's Dead". The camera focused almost exclusively on Murphy during most of the scene, panning only briefly to the stars David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve. Bauhaus reformed in 1998 for a tour.",

But an emerging fanzine culture identified with the group's sound and image, and slowly The Pastels started to influence a new wave of groups, which interested the NME and other UK media.The Pastels' sound continued to evolve and, although part of the NME's C86 compilation, in interviews they always sought to distance themselves from both twee and shambling developments. Their debut album, Up for a Bit With The Pastels (Glass, 1987; re-issue Paperhouse, 1991) moved from garage pop-punk through to ballads with synth orch splashes. In 2003, it was named the 37th best Scottish album by The Scotsman. The follow-up, Sittin' Pretty (Chapter 22, 1989) was harder but less eclectic.

Before forming the band, the brothers had spent five years on the dole, and in those five years they wrote and recorded songs at home and worked out the sound and image of the band.
